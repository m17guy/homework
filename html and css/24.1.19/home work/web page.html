		<h2>Borderlands 3 – What we know so far:</h2>
		<p class="space">Borderlands is a series of action role-playing first-person shooter video games set in space.
		<br>The game was created by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games.
		<br>The series currently consists of three games – Borderlands (2009), Borderlands 2 (2012) and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (2014).
		<br>While Borderlands 3 has’t been officially confirmed, another game in the series is pretty a given.
		<br>Rumours have been swimming around for a while now, in the wake of Borderlands 2’s massive success.
		<br>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford said at PAX East 2016: “It’s no secret, obviously there’s going to be another Borderlands.”
		<br>So while it may not be called Borderland 3 – there will definitely be another game.</p>
